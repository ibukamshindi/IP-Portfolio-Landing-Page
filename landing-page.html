    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Straight out of campus, I got the opportunity to learn auditing and that's what I have been doing for the past decade or so.
        You can give me receipts, invoices, bank statements and I will be able to extract a set of accounts from the information. 
        In addition have gained exposure to Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)serving the FiRe Award Committe as an evaluator and 
        applied and got a practicing certificate to sign off on audit reports.</p>

    <p>The need for the accountancy profession is declining, according to the World Econnomic Forum Future of Jobs Report 2018 <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2018.pdf">WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2018</a>
        employees will need reskilling and additional training to help them thrive in the work place of the future. Moringa presents an opportunity to learn and perhaps a stepping stone where the
        rest of your growth is upto to you having been pushed a little into the water and how far you venture is entirely up to you. </p>
