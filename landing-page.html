    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Straight out of campus, I got the opportunity to learn auditing and that's what I have been doing for the past decade or so.
        You can give me receipts, invoices, bank statements and I will be able to extract a set of accounts from the information. 
        In addition have gained exposure to Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) serving the FiRe Award Committee as an evaluator and 
        applied and got a practicing certificate to sign off on audit reports.</p>
    <p> On a trip to Kitale I cut off a branch and planted it in a container in the hopes that it would grow. The branch budded and this represents 
        me starting out in this vast field.</p>

    <p>The need for the accountancy profession is declining, according to the World Econnomic Forum Future of Jobs Report 2018 <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2018.pdf">WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2018</a>
        employees will need reskilling and additional training to help them thrive in the work place of the future. Moringa presents an opportunity to learn and perhaps a stepping stone where the
        rest of your growth is upto to you, having been pushed a little into the water and how far you venture is entirely up to you. </p>
