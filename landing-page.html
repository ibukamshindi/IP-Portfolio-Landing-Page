    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Straight out of campus, I got the opportunity to learn auditing and that's what I have been doing for the past decade or so.
        You can give me receipts, invoices, bank statements and I will be able to extract a set of accounts from the information. 
        In addition have gained exposure to Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)serving the FiRe Award Committe as an evaluator and 
        applied and got a practicing certificate to sign off on audit reports.</p>
    <p>The need for the accountancy profession is declining, according to the World Econnomic Forum Future of Jobs Report 2018 (put link)
        requiring the need for reskilling and additional training. Moringa presents an opportunity to learn and perhaps a stepping stone where the
        rest of your growth is upto to you having been pushed a little into the water and how far you venture is entirely up to you. </p>
